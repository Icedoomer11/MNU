			<h1 id="part-1-technical">Part 1. Technical</h1>
			<p>So we will break the thing into 3 parts.</p>
			<ol>
			<li>Technical. What is color and how color works.</li>
			<li>Design. What color looks good.</li>
			<li>Practical. How to use color in illustrator.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>We will start with the technical part. </p>
			<p>This will be simplified explanation. But I will try to touch on very complex things.
			So later when you run into problems you can research more.</p>

			<h2 id="what-is-light-">What is light.</h2>
			<ul>
			<li>Its a type of energy</li>
			<li>Change in frequency changes the color</li>
			<li><a href="sketch1Play.html">Play with light wave</a></li>

			<h2>Color on the screen </h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Is made by arranging millions of pixels.</li>
				<li>Each pixel has R,G,B led.</li>
				<li>By controlling the brightness of these, we control the color of the pixel.</li>
				<li>This is a very efficient method, because with only three colors we can recreate so many colors</li>

			<h2>Colors on the paper </h2>
			<ul>
			<li>Are also made differently. </li>
			<li>Printing is done by inking in CMYK color dots.</li>
			<li>Just like screen, printing is done by only a few colors.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>So now to jump into the problem.
			We have three things. </p>
			<ol>
			<li>The color in the real world</li>
			<li>Color on screen</li>
			<li>Color on printed paper</li>
			</ol>
			<p>And this is where we run into the issue. A color on the screen, is not the color you see on the when printed.</p>

			<h2 id="color-spectrum">Color spectrum</h2>
			<p>To understand what is we need to know about a little thing called. CIE color spectrum</p>


			<img src="pics/CIE2.png" alt="CIEDiagram">

			<p>This is all the colors the human can see.
			Also this chart is not actually 2D. its 3D and you kind of notice there are no dark colors but anyways. This is the whole spectrum of colors that the human can see.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>But this is the only part the can be shown on screen</li>
			<li>This is the only part that can be seen on printed paper.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Notice here</p>
			<ul>
			<li>The Reds, Green and Blue</li>
			</ul>
			<p>And thats why we have to switch between RGB,CMYK.
			If you use rgb. and print it. It cannot print this color
			Using CMYK lets you only use the colors the printer can print.</p>
			<p>That is the simplified version of color science and color management.
			This is important to know because this is how computers deal with colour</p>
			<p>So us working on digital screens work with R,G,B.
			But sometimes R G B is not efficient enough to do what we want.
			So we have things like. HSB Hexadecimal.

			<h1 id="part-2-design">Part 2. Design</h1>
			<p>Color carries 90% of your art work
			Whether its a video or photo, design, even physical products.</p>
			<p>This section is about finding out what colors work.</p>
			<p>Lets start of by playing with 2 colors.</p>
			<p>There are so many ways you can choose which 2 colors work.
			lets check in <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel">adobe site</a></p>
			<p>This is called. Color harmony.</p>
			<h2 id="complementary-color">Complementary color</h2>
			<p>Lets start with</p>
			<ol>
			<li>Complementary
			Complementary is easiest to understand. It is the opposite color.
			Opposite color works well</li>
			</ol>

			<h1 id="part-3-application">Part 3. Application</h1>
			<p>As said in last class. You can apply a color or gradient to any stroke or fill.</p>
			<p>Find the color tab in windows.
			Lets explore this. </p>
			<p>Lets create some artboards. 
			Artboards a different from Documents.
			These are documents. These are artboards. These boards can be individually exported.
			And we will do that today</p>
			<p>Make a total of 9 artboards.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Use the artboard tool to draw one artboard.</li>
			<li>Go to window -&gt; artboard.</li>
			<li>Arrange them to a grid of 3x3. Spacing of 50px.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Lets create simple artworks.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Look at the sheet.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can use illustrator color guide.</p>
